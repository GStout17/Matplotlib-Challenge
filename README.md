# Squamous Cell Carcinoma Analysis

# Background

- This repository is looking at pharmaceutical anti-cancer data using matplotlib. 
- The data in question is screening potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
- In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. 
- Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. 
- The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.

# Tasks used to manipulate data
- Cleaning data by organizing and updating data frames 
- Finding errors, duplicates, and outliers in the data set
- Creating summary statics of relevant information
- Finding correlation coefficients and regressions
- Chart include: Bar, Pie, Boxplots, Line, and Scatter Plots

# Observations and Insights
1. There's a large correlation of 0.59 between mouse weight and tumor volume. This implies that larger mice may have larger tumor volumes but there can be other third variables not taken into consideration.

2. There is an almost even split between male and female mice. This shows a good sample size between each sex and an ability to see if there is any differences or similarities. Refer to the pie chart to see this information.

3. Of the top four drug regimens, Capomulin and Ramicane had the best final tumor volume results. This can be seen in the boxplot data. Meaning the final tumor volume was smaller compared to Infubinol and Cerfamin.
