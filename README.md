# Matplotlib-Challenge

# Background

- This repository is looking at pharmaceutical anti-cancer data using matplotlib. 
- The data in question is screening potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
- In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. 
- Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. 
- The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.

# Tasks used to manipulate data
- Cleaning data by organizing and updating data frames 
- Finding errors, duplicates, and outliers in the data set
- Creating summary statics of relevant information
- Finding correlation coefficients and regressions
- Chart include: Bar, Pie, Boxplots, Line, and Scatter Plots
